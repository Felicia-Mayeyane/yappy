**Link to project:** no live anymore. under construction! ( coming soon)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,  NodeJs, PassportJs, ExpressJS and MongoDB

## Optimizations

Security and making changes to the interface. The application will move to a cloud based storage in order to be store video content from the application, at this time all video recording done on the app can be dowloaded to the users machine however cannot be stored in the current database, this is due to the size of video content.



## Lessons Learned:

Documentation is king! This still rings true. I am working on improving the application and working on bugs that don't seem to go away this has made me lean more towards TDD using Jest to fall into the habit of testing as i develop whenever the need arises.
